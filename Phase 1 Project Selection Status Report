Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

One can prove that under boundedness conditions, unique smooth solutions of partial differential equations are computable from the parameters.(http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.3763v2.pdf) Even though the algorithm is inefficient. However, in numerical research specialized algorithms are written for specific differential equations (which can take months), and then run only a few times. Thus, there is a large degree of tolerance for inefficiency before the abstract algorithm would become useless. 
Goal of the project is to implement the abstract algorithm to solve partial differential equations by implementing the idea of exact real number and represented space in ML. 
We can then implement the algorithm with C++ using iRRAM(the exaxt arithmatic package in C++) to compare the effiency both in terms of time and memory with the ML implementation. 

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.


my own machine for coding - late 2013 Macbook pro
backup options - dropbox, google drive
version control - Github
